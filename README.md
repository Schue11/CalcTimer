# CalcTimer

Through the use of in-class generated code as well as individual generated code, I was able to analyse several aspects of the computation processes whilst using the computer. First I compaired adding floats and adding doubles together. We saw in our calculation that time to compute addition using floats vs doubles had little to no difference it computation time. That said, when we compaired computing the square of a double using the square root process vs the built in math process, we saw that the math.pow provess took signficantly longer than simply creating a sqrt function.
